Core components for a tutorial/short course
===============================================
# installing Nimble

(*) BUGS basics

(*) lightning intro with pump

(*) build and operate a Nimble model from R (including compilation)

data/constants/nodes/inits/RHS variables

build and operate an MCMC from R (including compilation)
(extended MCMC example with litters as separate module?)

swapping out MCMC components
(have them see compareMCMCs)

MCEM example

PF example

writing a user-defined sampler - perhaps show Perry's logSD sampler

writing a full user-defined algo - perhaps show importance sampler?

user-defined distributions

user-defined nf's in BUGS code - example of how to speed processing and of how to do something customizable

strategies for improved MCMC:
modifyign samplers
vectorized - deterministic node statements and possibly vectorized univar nodes - fewer nodes though in some cases of MCMC does unnecessary calcs
user-defined fxns
user-defined dists

censoring/truncation

example of nimbleFunction w/o setupCode

Examples from talks
==============================================

litters MCMC: default MCMC, blocking, cross-level

Possible examples:

Paleon prediction of biomass from pollen - user-defined Dirich-multinomial

Paleon tree growth model - generally complicated model, can illustrate dinterval/dconstraint, multiple parameterizations 

Daniel capture-recapture example with filtered likelihood: dipper, orchid, goose

Nick's stochastic volatity model with Liu & West filter or PMCMC

MCMC comparisons ice example (use of blocking) (smoothing model); add autoBlock from DT paper

election88 example w/ customized samplers: oppositional proposals for fixed effects, customized cross-level; also vectorized calculation

DT autoBlock GLMM example (MN health plan) - probably redundant with election88

importance sampling example for nf

spatial C-R  - Jimenez (ask if ok) - ideas for squeezing out speed (vectorize, 0/1 indicator Gibbs sample)

Rewriting a model for efficiency (vectorization, etc.) using Perry's tricks
vectorized scalar distributions sampled in a block
[need to figure out a good list of these]

Overview materials

Perry Neyman UCB talk Oct 2015

various other Perry talks (similar material)

Exercises
=======================================================

1) take a BUGS model example and build it in Nimble and set up an MCMC; change the defaults

2) modify a BUGS model to use a user-defined fxn and user-defined distribution

3) write a nimbleFunction for a basic algo
