Core components for a tutorial/short course
===============================================
# installing Nimble

(*) lightning intro w/ pump:
 -BUGS basics
 - build and operate a Nimble model from R (including compilation)

(*) data/constants/nodes/inits/RHS variables, alternate params

(*) build and operate an MCMC from R (including compilation)

(extended MCMC example with litters as separate module?)
swapping out MCMC components
(have them see compareMCMCs)

censoring/truncation
possible examples: normal mixture with means ordered; survival data; use of Gelman truncated t prior for sd in random effects models
two-group random effects with mean for one group less than for other and Gelman t-prior

(*) example of nimbleFunction w/o setupCode

(*) basic nimbleFunction example

nested nimbleFunctions in simulation study example?

MCEM example

PF example

writing a user-defined sampler - perhaps show Perry's logSD sampler

writing a full user-defined algo - perhaps show importance sampler?

capture-recapture: user-def lik and user-defined distribution

(*) user-defined distributions

using modelValues

user-defined distribution - extended example - dCaptureRecapture?

user-defined nf's in BUGS code - example of how to speed processing and of how to do something customizable

user-defined nfs example - b-spline basis

strategies for improved MCMC:
modifyign samplers
vectorized - deterministic node statements and possibly vectorized univar nodes - fewer nodes though in some cases of MCMC does unnecessary calcs
user-defined fxns 
user-defined dists to integrate over nodes


Examples from talks
==============================================

litters MCMC: default MCMC, blocking, cross-level

Possible examples:

Paleon prediction of biomass from pollen - user-defined Dirich-multinomial

Paleon tree growth model - generally complicated model, can illustrate dinterval/dconstraint, multiple parameterizations 

Daniel capture-recapture example with filtered likelihood: dipper, orchid, goose

Nick's stochastic volatity model with Liu & West filter or PMCMC

MCMC comparisons ice example (use of blocking) (smoothing model); add autoBlock from DT paper

election88 example w/ customized samplers: oppositional proposals for fixed effects, customized cross-level; also vectorized calculation

DT autoBlock GLMM example (MN health plan) - probably redundant with election88

importance sampling example for nf

spatial C-R  - Jimenez (ask if ok) - ideas for squeezing out speed (vectorize, 0/1 indicator Gibbs sample)

Rewriting a model for efficiency (vectorization, etc.) using Perry's tricks
vectorized scalar distributions sampled in a block
[need to figure out a good list of these]
