# Introduction

Nimble's MCMC system was designed to be extensible - it's easy for users to add samplers and use them right away for their models.

Let's start with a very basic example that slightly extends Nimble's built-in Metropolis sampler.

# The reflection sampler

Suppose you have a parameter with a finite domain, in particular a fixed lower bound, such as a gamma distribution, a uniform distribution, or a lognormal distribution.

A standard Metropolis sampler could propose a value that is below the lower bound. This would give a probability density for the proposed value that is $0$ so the proposal would be rejected. That's fine, but it wastes the computation involved in proposing the value and determining that it should be rejected. If the current value of the parameter under consideration is near the bound, this will happen nearly 50% of the time. 

Instead, we can use *reflection*. If the proposed $\theta^\prime < b$ where $b$ is the bound, simply set $\theta^\prime$ to $b + (b-\theta^\prime)$

# Writing a nimbleFunction for the reflection sampler

The *run* function for the reflection sampler needs to check the proposed value against the distribution bounds and modify the proposal as needed.

However, we first need to modify the *setup* function to check if the distribution has finite lower or upper bounds and only consider scalar parameters, thereby avoiding some computation at run-time. 

```{r, reflect-sampler}
sampler_RW_reflect <- nimbleFunction(
    contains = sampler_BASE,
    setup = function(model, mvSaved, target, control, scale) {
        dist <- model$getNodeDistribution(target)
        scalar <- getDistribution(dist)$types$value$nDim == 0
        if(scalar)
                rg <- getDistribution(dist)$range
        if(scalar && (rg[1] > -Inf || rg[2] < Inf))
                  reflect <- TRUE else reflect <- FALSE

        calcNodes  <- model$getDependencies(target)
    },
    
    run = function() {
        propValue <- rnorm(1, mean = model[[target]], sd = scale)

        if(reflect) {
             if(propValue < rg[1]) propValue <- 2*rg[1] - propValue
             if(propValue > rg[2]) propValue <- 2*rg[2] - propValue
        }
 
        model[[target]] <<- propValue
        logMHR <- calculateDiff(model, calcNodes)
        jump <- decide(logMHR)
        if(jump)
            nimCopy(from = model, to = mvSaved, row = 1, nodes = calcNodes, 
                         logProb = TRUE)
        else
            nimCopy(from = mvSaved, to = model, row = 1, nodes = calcNodes, 
                         logProb = TRUE)
    },
    methods = list(
            reset = function () {}
            )
)
```


# Comments

1) This implementation doesn't account for bounds induced by user-defined truncation of a node in a model nor the bounds defined by the parameters of a uniform distribution. That would require more diving into Nimble's internal plumbing, though in the future more information on the bounds of a node at run-time should be available.

2) We used some functionality that may not be fully explained in Nimble's documentation. For this sort of thing, you can always ask a question in the Nimble user Google group. 

# Nimble's Metropolis sampler

Often it's easiest when writing a new sampler that is similar to an existing Nimble sampler to just modify the code for the existing sampler. In this case, Nimble's exisiting random walk sampler has some nice additional functionality that we can include in our reflection sampler, specifically the ability to adapt the proposal variance. 

Let's look at the code for the Metropolis sampler. You can find this in the file *R/MCMC_samplers.R* in the source code for the Nimble package (note that ```nimble:::sampler_RW``` is not useful to look at, as it shows a modified version of this -- the nimbleFunction after it has been built).

```{r, Metr}
sampler_RW <- nimbleFunction(
    contains = sampler_BASE,
    setup = function(model, mvSaved, target, control) {
        ###  control list extraction  ###
        adaptive      <- control$adaptive
        adaptInterval <- control$adaptInterval
        scale         <- control$scale
        ###  node list generation  ###
        targetAsScalar <- model$expandNodeNames(target, 
                       returnScalarComponents = TRUE)
        if(length(targetAsScalar) > 1)     
                        stop('more than one target; cannot use RW sampler, try RW_block sampler')
        calcNodes  <- model$getDependencies(target)
        ###  numeric value generation  ###

    },
    
    run = function() {
        propValue <- rnorm(1, mean = model[[target]], sd = scale)
     	model[[target]] <<- propValue
        logMHR <- calculateDiff(model, calcNodes)
        jump <- decide(logMHR)
        if(jump)
            nimCopy(from = model, to = mvSaved, row = 1, nodes = calcNodes,

    },
    
    methods = list(
        
        adaptiveProcedure = function(jump = logical()) {
            timesRan <<- timesRan + 1
            if(jump)     timesAccepted <<- timesAccepted + 1
            if(timesRan %% adaptInterval == 0) {
                acceptanceRate <- timesAccepted / timesRan
                timesAdapted <<- timesAdapted + 1
                setSize(scaleHistory,          timesAdapted)
                setSize(acceptanceRateHistory, timesAdapted)
                scaleHistory[timesAdapted] <<- scale
                acceptanceRateHistory[timesAdapted] <<- acceptanceRate
                gamma1 <<- 1/((timesAdapted + 3)^0.8)
                gamma2 <- 10 * gamma1
                adaptFactor <- exp(gamma2 * (acceptanceRate - optimalAR))
                scale <<- scale * adaptFactor
                timesRan <<- 0
                timesAccepted <<- 0
            }
        },
        
        reset = function() {
            scale <<- scaleOriginal
            timesRan      <<- 0
            timesAccepted <<- 0
            timesAdapted  <<- 0
            scaleHistory          <<- scaleHistory          * 0
            acceptanceRateHistory <<- acceptanceRateHistory * 0
            gamma1 <<- 0
        }
    ), where = getLoadingNamespace()
)

```

Much of that code has to do with making the sampler adaptive, so that the proposal scale adapts so that a good acceptance rate is achieved.

# The full reflection sampler function

Below is the full new reflection sampler, building on Nimble's baseline random walk sampler to include adaptation.


```{r, newSampler}
sampler_RW_reflect <- nimbleFunction(
    contains = sampler_BASE,
    setup = function(model, mvSaved, target, control) {
        ###  control list extraction  ###
        adaptive      <- control$adaptive
        adaptInterval <- control$adaptInterval
        scale         <- control$scale
        ###  node list generation  ###
        targetAsScalar <- model$expandNodeNames(target, 
                       returnScalarComponents = TRUE)
        if(length(targetAsScalar) > 1)     
                       stop('more than one target; cannot use RW sampler, try RW_block sampler')

# Using the sampler

Using the sampler is simple. Just modify the default MCMC configuration for a model to use the new sampler on a node of interest.

Let's try this with the *blocker* model, which is a random effects meta-analysis of clinical trial data. 


In this case, we could use a conjugate sampler, which would automatically respect the lower bound of zero, but for illustration let's compare a standard Metropolis sampler with the new reflection sampler. 

```{r, blocker}
model <- readBUGSmodel('blocker', dir = system.file('classic-bugs','vol1','blocker', package = 'nimble'))
model$tau
model$tau <- 0.01
conf <- configureMCMC(model)
conf$removeSamplers('tau')
# as baseline, use standard Metropolis for tau
conf$addSampler('tau', type = 'RW')
mcmc <- buildMCMC(conf)
niter <- 10000
cmodel <- compileNimble(model)
cmcmc <- compileNimble(mcmc, project = model)
set.seed(0)
cmcmc$run(niter)
smp1 <- as.matrix(cmcmc$mvSamples)
```

```{r, scopefix, echo=FALSE}
# not clear why sampler_RW_reflect() not being put into global
# if this isn't done, configureMCMC fails to find sampler_RW_reflect in knitr
assign('sampler_RW_reflect', sampler_RW_reflect, .GlobalEnv)
```

Now we'll try the reflection sampler instead.

```{r, add-reflect}
conf$removeSamplers('tau')
# for comparison, consider the reflection sampler
conf$addSampler('tau', type = 'RW_reflect')
mcmc <- buildMCMC(conf)
cmcmc <- compileNimble(mcmc, project = model, resetFunctions = TRUE)

nimCopy(model, cmodel)
set.seed(0)
cmcmc$run(niter)
smp2 <- as.matrix(cmcmc$mvSamples)

nplot <- 300
plot(seq_len(nplot), smp1[seq_len(nplot), 'tau'], type = 'l')
lines(seq_len(nplot), smp2[seq_len(nplot), 'tau'], col = 'red')
library(coda, quietly = TRUE)
effectiveSize(smp1[ , 'tau'])
effectiveSize(smp2[ , 'tau'])
```

So we see that the sampler escaped from near zero more quickly, though given that the posterior is well away from zero, the new sampler didn't make much difference in the overall MCMC performance. 

Side note: the random effects variance component in this model is given a gamma prior on the precision scale, but best practices for random effects variance components, including a strong argument against the gamma/inverse-gamma prior, can be found in Gelman (2006, Bayesian Analysis 1:515-534).
