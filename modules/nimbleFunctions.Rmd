# Introduction

*nimbleFunctions* are at the heart of NIMBLE. They are the way that algorithms are implemented. They can also be used for user-defined functions and samplers for use in BUGS code (see the [user_function](user_function.html) and [user_sampler](user_sampler.html) modules) and they can be used to compile parts of R (see the *compile_R* module), without reference to a model. But their main purpose is providing a way for developers to implement algorithms.

# Components of a nimbleFunction

NIMBLE uses the concept of *two-stage evaluation* from computer science to run a model-specific algorithm based on model-generic algorithm code. The first stage of evaluation specializes the algorithm to the model of interest via *setup* code. The second stage runs the algorithm via *run* code. 

Thus, a nimbleFunction has two parts:

 - setup code: used to tailor the algorithm to a particular model structure. Often this involves determining dependencies amongst nodes in the model and setting up storage using modelValues
 - run code: the guts of the algorithm, written generically so it will apply to any (appropriate) model

Setup code is written as a R function, using R code, usually including NIMBLE's special functions for querying the model structure (see the module *model_structure*). 

Run code is written using the NIMBLE DSL. While this is formally a language distinct from R, you can just think of it as a subset of R, enhanced with some functions for operating on the model (see the module *operating_model*). 

# Some syntax for nimbleFunctions

Here are some of the functions you may use in the run function of a nimbleFunction:

 - *returnType*, e.g. ```returnType(double(1))``` for a vector of reals
 - *length*, e.g., ```length(x)``` to determine the length of a run-time argument *x*
 - *declare*, e.g., ```declare(result, double(1))``` to create a vector of reals called *result*
 - *setSize*, e.g., ```setSize(result, n)``` to set the size of the vector to be length *n*
 - *calculate*, *simulate*, *getLogProb* to manipulate the model
 - *values* and *nimCopy* to copy values
 - *print*
 - random number generation functions, e.g., ```rnorm(1, 100, 5)``` (these must always only generate a single random variable)

Section 9 of the NIMBLE User Manual describes the syntax for *run* code in detail, including lots of neat functionality such as using nested nimbleFunctions and having multiple run-time functions (i.e., methods) as part of a nimbleFunction.


# A basic example

Let's consider how we would optimize the parameters in a model using a nimbleFunction. Basically, we'll just construct an objective function that we can then pass to R's *optim* function to do the actual numerical optimization.

This amounts to setting things up to find the posterior mode of a model; this is generally a reasonable thing to do only for models with a small number of parameters and without hierarchical structure.

Here's the generic nimbleFunction that could be used with any model.

```{r, nf}
objective <- nimbleFunction(
    setup = function(model, target) {
          calcNodes <- model$getDependencies(target)
          },
    run = function(par = double(1)) {
        returnType(double(0))
        values(model, target) <<- par
        ans <- model$calculate(calcNodes)
        return(ans)
    }
)
```

# Using the nimbleFunction on a model

Let's try to optimize the parameters of GLM, in particular a basic logistic regression, for which the maximum likelihood estimates are not available in closed form.

We'll build the model and then create a nimbleFunction specific to the actual model. And we'll create a compiled version of that nimbleFunction to use in the actual optimization.

```{r, model}
code <- nimbleCode({
     for(i in 1:n) {
           y[i] ~ dbern(p[i])
           p[i] <- expit(b0 + b1*x[i])
     }
})
n <- 300
b0 <- -0.5
b1 <- 4
x <- runif(n, -1, 1)
p <- expit(b0 + b1*x)
y <- rbinom(n, 1, p)

model <- nimbleModel(code, constants = list(n = n, x = x),
      data = list(y = y), inits = list(b0 = 0, b1 =0))
Cmodel <- compileNimble(model)
logistic_obj <- objective(model, c('b0', 'b1'))
Clogistic_obj <- compileNimble(logistic_obj, project = model)
```

Now let's run the optimization and compare to R's *glm* function. 

```{r, optimizer}
out <- optim(c(Cmodel$b0, Cmodel$b1), Clogistic_obj$run, 
    control = list(fnscale = -1))
out$par
glm(y ~ x, family = 'binomial')
```

Looks like it works.
