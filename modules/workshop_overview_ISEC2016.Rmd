How nimble goes beyond other packages
how you could build on nimble


to do:
Understanding graphical models
 - inspect state-space model and make more efficient version

compiling from R to C++ with nimbleFunctions
 - no setup code

User-defined distributions and functions
 - multi-state capture-recapture example

Model-generic programming
 - making a general simulator

Writing new MCMC samplers
 - spatial capture-recapture example
Understanding graphical models
running MCEM
add slice sampler on mean.r to the customization case

smc
mcem
