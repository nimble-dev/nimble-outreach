How nimble goes beyond other packages
how you could build on nimble

Programming with models (I): Operating a model

to do:


Understanding graphical models
 - inspect state-space model and make more efficient version

compiling from R to C++ with nimbleFunctions
 - no setup code

User-defined distributions and functions
 - multi-state capture-recapture example

Model-generic programming
 - making a general simulator

Writing new MCMC samplers
 - spatial capture-recapture example
Understanding graphical models
running MCEM
add slice sampler on mean.r to the customization case

add includeData = TRUE to simulate example

add exercises at the end of operating_model module

try to add a link to code file on each first slide

check on title slide creation and see if there is a way to put a content description
