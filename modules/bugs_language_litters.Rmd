# The BUGS language

The BUGS language is described in detail in the NIMBLE manual and in the [relevant section of the BUGS manual](http://www.openbugs.net/Manuals/ModelSpecification.html). 

### Stochastic declarations

  - `x ~ dgamma(shape, scale)` (`x` follows a gamma distribution with parameters `shape` and `scale`)

### Deterministic declarations

  - `y <- 2 * x`

### For loops

  - `for(i in 1:10) {x[i] <- exp(y[i])}`

### Classic BUGS examples

There are lots of example models originally provided by the BUGS project:

  - included in NIMBLE or found here on the [JAGS website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/Examples/).
  - Information: [Volume 1](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS_Vol1.pdf), [Volume 2](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS_Vol2.pdf), and [Volume 3](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS_Vol3.pdf) of the WinBUGS example manuals.

### NIMBLE's dialect of BUGS

   - The BUGS syntax used in NIMBLE has minor differences from that used in WinBUGS, OpenBUGS and/or JAGS. We'll see some of this as we go along.
   - Also described in Section 5 of the [NIMBLE Users Manual](http://r-nimble.org/manuals/NimbleUserManual.pdf).


# A basic example


We'll use the *litters* model example from the original BUGS examples, available with NIMBLE in the *classic-bugs/vol1/litters* directory of the installed package (call ```searchpaths()``` after loading the NIMBLE package to find where this directory is). The data set describes the survival rates of rat pups in an experiment.

Here's the original litters model. There are ```G=2``` groups of rat litters, with ```N=16```  litters (i.e., mothers) in each group, and a variable number of pups in each litter. Survival of the pups in a litter is governed by a survival probability for each litter, ```p[i,j]```, but the probabilities for the litters within a group are considered to come from a common distribution, thereby borrowing strength across the litters in a group. The common distributions are $p_{1,j} \sim \mbox{Beta(a_1, b_1)}$ for group 1 and $p_{2,j} \sim \mbox{Beta(a_2, b_2)}$ for group 2.

# Specifying the BUGS code for a model

Here we specify the litters model code directly in R. We can walk through some of details via the comments in the BUGS code.


```{r, model-code}
library(nimble)
littersCode <- nimbleCode({
  for (i in 1:G) {
     for (j in 1:N) {
     	# likelihood (data model)
        r[i,j] ~ dbin(p[i,j], n[i,j])
	# latent process (random effects)
        p[i,j] ~ dbeta(a[i], b[i]) 
     }
     # prior for hyperparameters
     # such gamma priors are not generally recommended, but
     # these are the priors from the original example
     a[i] ~ dgamma(1, .001)
     b[i] ~ dgamma(1, .001)
   }
})
```
