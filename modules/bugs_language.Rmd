# The BUGS language

The BUGS language is described in detail in the [relevant section of the BUGS manual](http://www.openbugs.net/Manuals/ModelSpecification.html). 

Basically, one specifies the variables in the hierarchical model as lines of code:

  - stochastic nodes (data and parameters) are indicated with `~`
  - deterministic nodes (which are deterministic functions of other nodes and of constants) are indicated by `<-`.

There are lots of example models from the classic BUGS examples provided in the classic-bugs directory of the installed Nimble R package or from the [JAGS website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/Examples/).  Information about the models can be found in [Volume 1](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS_Vol1.pdf), [Volume 2](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS_Vol2.pdf), and [Volume 3](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS_Vol3.pdf) of the WinBUGS example manuals.

Information on how Nimble's 'dialect' of BUGS differs from the original and information on the distributions and functions provided in Nimble can be found in Section 5 of the [Nimble Users Manual](http://r-nimble.org/manuals/NimbleUserManual.pdf).

# A basic example


We'll use the *pump* model example from the original BUGS software. The data set
  describes the failure rates of some pumps.  

<center><img src="figures/pumpDAG.jpg"></center>

In this model, there are $N=10$ pumps. The number of failures, $x_i$, for pump $i$ is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, with mean $\lambda_i = \theta_i \cdot t_i$ where $t_i$ is the length of operation of the pump in thousands of hours and $\theta_i$ is the failure rate. The model then borrows strength across pumps with a prior that ties the random effects together using a common distribution, $\theta_i \sim \mbox{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)$. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the hyperparameters of this random effects distribution. 

# Specifying the BUGS code for a model

Here we specify the pump code directly in R. We can walk through some of details via the comments in the BUGS code.

```{r model-code}
library(nimble)
pumpCode <- nimbleCode({ 
  for (i in 1:N){

      # likelihood (data model)
      x[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i])

      # latent process (random effects)
      # linear predictor      
      lambda[i] <- theta[i]*t[i]
      # random effects distribution
      theta[i] ~ dgamma(alpha,beta)
  }
  # priors on hyperparameters
  alpha ~ dexp(1.0)
  beta ~ dgamma(0.1,1.0)
})
```
