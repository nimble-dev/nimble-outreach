# Introduction

NIMBLE's MCMC system was designed to be extensible - it's easy for users to add samplers and use them right away for their models.

Here we'll see a pretty easy extension of one of NIMBLE's built-in samplers.

In many cases you might want to do some very specific sampling approach for one or a few parameters in your model and rely on NIMBLE's built-in samplers for the rest of the model. This module illustrates how you could do that.

# The reflection sampler

Suppose you have a parameter with a finite domain, in particular a fixed lower bound, such as a gamma distribution, a uniform distribution, or a lognormal distribution.

A standard Metropolis sampler could propose a value that is below the lower bound. This would give a probability density for the proposed value that is `0` so the proposal would be rejected. That's fine, but it wastes the computation involved in proposing the value and determining that it should be rejected. If the current value of the parameter under consideration is near the bound, this will happen nearly 50% of the time. 

Instead, we can use *reflection*. If the proposed $\theta^\prime < b$ where $b$ is the bound, simply set $\theta^\prime$ to $b + (b-\theta^\prime)$

# NIMBLE's built-in random walk sampler

Here's a simplified version of the random walk sampler used for NIMBLE's MCMC engine. Note that this simplification excludes the use of an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the proposal standard deviation to the acceptance rate as the MCMC iterations proceed.

```{r, basic-sampler, eval=FALSE}
sampler_RW <- nimbleFunction(
    contains = sampler_BASE,  # some object-oriented syntax for MCMC samplers
    setup = function(model, mvSaved, target, control) {
        targetAsScalar <- model$expandNodeNames(target, 
                                                returnScalarComponents = TRUE)
        if(length(targetAsScalar) > 1)   
           stop('cannot use RW sampler on more than one target; try RW_block sampler')
        if(model$isDiscrete(target))     
           stop('cannot use RW sampler on discrete-valued target; try slice sampler')
        ###  control list extraction  ###
        scale <- control$scale
        ###  node list generation  ###
        calcNodes  <- model$getDependencies(target)
    },

    run = function() {
        currentValue <- model[[target]]
        # note that scale is available because created in setup code
        propValue <- rnorm(1, mean = currentValue,  sd = scale)
        model[[target]] <<- propValue
        logMHR <- calculateDiff(model, calcNodes) 
        jump <- decide(logMHR)
        if(jump) nimCopy(from = model, to = mvSaved, row = 1, 
                         nodes = calcNodes, logProb = TRUE)
        else     nimCopy(from = mvSaved, to = model, row = 1, 
                         nodes = calcNodes, logProb = TRUE)
    },
    
    where = getLoadingNamespace()
)
```

# Writing a nimbleFunction for the reflection sampler

The *run* function for the reflection sampler needs to check the proposed value against the distribution bounds and modify the proposal as needed.

However, we first need to modify the *setup* function to check if the distribution has finite lower or upper bounds and only consider scalar parameters, thereby avoiding some computation at run-time. 

```{r, reflect-sampler}
RW_reflect <- nimbleFunction(
    contains = sampler_BASE,
    setup = function(model, mvSaved, target, control) {
        dist <- model$getDistribution(target)
        targetComponents <- model$expandNodeNames(target, returnScalarComponents = TRUE)
        if(length(targetComponents) > 1)
                stop("RW_reflect: cannot use univariate RW sampler on multivariate target, try RW_block sampler.")
        rg <- getDistribution(dist)$range
        if(rg[1] > -Inf || rg[2] < Inf)
                  reflect <- TRUE else reflect <- FALSE

        calcNodes  <- model$getDependencies(target)
    },
    
    run = function() {
        propValue <- rnorm(1, mean = model[[target]], sd = scale)

        if(reflect) {
            lower <- model$getBound(target, 'lower')
            upper <- model$getBound(target, 'upper')
             if(propValue < lower) propValue <- 2*lower - propValue
             if(propValue > upper) propValue <- 2*upper - propValue
        }
 
        model[[target]] <<- propValue
        logMHR <- calculateDiff(model, calcNodes)
        jump <- decide(logMHR)
        if(jump)
            nimCopy(from = model, to = mvSaved, row = 1, nodes = calcNodes, 
                         logProb = TRUE)
        else
            nimCopy(from = mvSaved, to = model, row = 1, nodes = calcNodes, 
                         logProb = TRUE)
    },
    methods = list(
            reset = function () {}
            )
)
```


Comment: We used some functionality that may not be fully explained in NIMBLE's documentation. For this sort of thing, you can always ask a question in the NIMBLE user Google group. 

# NIMBLE's Metropolis sampler

Often it's easiest when writing a new sampler that is similar to an existing NIMBLE sampler to just modify the code for the existing sampler. In this case, NIMBLE's existing random walk sampler has some nice additional functionality that we can include in our reflection sampler, specifically the ability to adapt the proposal variance. 

Let's look at the code for the Metropolis sampler. You can find this in the file *R/MCMC_samplers.R* in the source code for the NIMBLE package (note that ```nimble:::sampler_RW``` is not useful to look at, as it shows a modified version of this, namely the nimbleFunction after it has been built).

```{r, Metr}
sampler_RW <- nimbleFunction(
    contains = sampler_BASE,
    setup = function(model, mvSaved, target, control) {
        ###  control list extraction - not yet finalized, so have placeholders ###
        adaptive      <- TRUE ## control$adaptive
        adaptInterval <- 100  ## control$adaptInterval
        scale         <- 1    ## control$scale
        ###  node list generation  ###
        targetAsScalar <- model$expandNodeNames(target, 
                       returnScalarComponents = TRUE)
        if(length(targetAsScalar) > 1)     
                        stop('more than one target; cannot use RW sampler, try RW_block sampler')
        calcNodes  <- model$getDependencies(target)
        ###  numeric value generation  ###
        scaleOriginal <- scale
        timesRan      <- 0
        timesAccepted <- 0
        timesAdapted  <- 0
        scaleHistory          <- c(0, 0)
        acceptanceRateHistory <- c(0, 0)
        ## variables previously inside of nested functions:
        optimalAR <- 0.44
        gamma1    <- 0
    },
    
    run = function() {
        propValue <- rnorm(1, mean = model[[target]], sd = scale)
     	model[[target]] <<- propValue
        logMHR <- calculateDiff(model, calcNodes)
        jump <- decide(logMHR)
        if(jump)
            nimCopy(from = model, to = mvSaved, row = 1, nodes = calcNodes, 
                         logProb = TRUE)
        else
            nimCopy(from = mvSaved, to = model, row = 1, nodes = calcNodes, 
                         logProb = TRUE)
        if(adaptive)     adaptiveProcedure(jump)
    },
    
    methods = list(
        
        adaptiveProcedure = function(jump = logical()) {
            timesRan <<- timesRan + 1
            if(jump)     timesAccepted <<- timesAccepted + 1
            if(timesRan %% adaptInterval == 0) {
                acceptanceRate <- timesAccepted / timesRan
                timesAdapted <<- timesAdapted + 1
                setSize(scaleHistory,          timesAdapted)
                setSize(acceptanceRateHistory, timesAdapted)
                scaleHistory[timesAdapted] <<- scale
                acceptanceRateHistory[timesAdapted] <<- acceptanceRate
                gamma1 <<- 1/((timesAdapted + 3)^0.8)
                gamma2 <- 10 * gamma1
                adaptFactor <- exp(gamma2 * (acceptanceRate - optimalAR))
                scale <<- scale * adaptFactor
                timesRan <<- 0
                timesAccepted <<- 0
            }
        },
        
        reset = function() {
            scale <<- scaleOriginal
            timesRan      <<- 0
            timesAccepted <<- 0
            timesAdapted  <<- 0
            scaleHistory          <<- scaleHistory          * 0
            acceptanceRateHistory <<- acceptanceRateHistory * 0
            gamma1 <<- 0
        }
        
    ), where = getLoadingNamespace()
)

```

Much of that code has to do with making the sampler adaptive, so that the proposal scale adapts so that a good acceptance rate is achieved.

# The full reflection sampler function

Below is the full new reflection sampler, building on NIMBLE's baseline random walk sampler to include adaptation.


```{r, newSampler}
RW_reflect <- nimbleFunction(
    contains = sampler_BASE,
    setup = function(model, mvSaved, target, control) {
        ###  control list extraction - not yet set up ###
        adaptive      <- TRUE ## control$adaptive
        adaptInterval <- 100  ## control$adaptInterval
        scale         <- 1    ##control$scale
        ###  node list generation  ###
        targetAsScalar <- model$expandNodeNames(target, 
                       returnScalarComponents = TRUE)
        if(length(targetAsScalar) > 1)     
                       stop('more than one target; cannot use RW sampler, try RW_block sampler')

# Using the sampler

Using the sampler is simple. Just modify the default MCMC configuration for a model to use the new sampler on a node of interest.

Let's try this with the *blocker* model, which is a random effects meta-analysis of clinical trial data. 


In this case, we could use a conjugate sampler, which would automatically respect the lower bound of zero, but for illustration let's compare a standard Metropolis sampler with the new reflection sampler. 

```{r, blocker}
model <- readBUGSmodel('blocker', dir = system.file('classic-bugs',
      'vol1','blocker', package = 'nimble'))
model$tau
model$tau <- 0.01
conf <- configureMCMC(model)
conf$removeSamplers('tau')
# as baseline, use standard Metropolis for tau
conf$addSampler('tau', type = 'RW')
mcmc <- buildMCMC(conf)
niter <- 25000
cmodel <- compileNimble(model)
cmcmc <- compileNimble(mcmc, project = model)
set.seed(1)
smp1 <- runMCMC(cmcmc, niter = 25000)
```

```{r, scopefix, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='', fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
# not clear why RW_reflect() not being put into global
# if this isn't done, configureMCMC fails to find sampler_RW_reflect in knitr
assign('RW_reflect', RW_reflect, .GlobalEnv)
```

Now we'll try the reflection sampler instead. We can just assign it as a sampler
in the way we've seen before.

```{r, add-reflect}
conf$removeSamplers('tau')
# for comparison, consider the reflection sampler
conf$addSampler('tau', type = 'RW_reflect')
mcmc <- buildMCMC(conf)
cmcmc <- compileNimble(mcmc, project = model, resetFunctions = TRUE)

nimCopy(model, cmodel)  # initialize 2nd MCMC same as 1st MCMC
set.seed(1)
smp2 <- runMCMC(cmcmc, niter = 25000)

nplot <- 300
burnin <- 1000
plot(seq_len(nplot), smp1[seq_len(nplot), 'tau'], type = 'l', 
                     xlab = 'iteration', ylab=expression(tau))
lines(seq_len(nplot), smp2[seq_len(nplot), 'tau'], col = 'red')
library(coda, quietly = TRUE)
effectiveSize(log(smp1[(burnin+1):niter , 'tau']))
effectiveSize(log(smp2[(burnin+1):niter , 'tau']))
```

So we see that the sampler escaped from near zero more quickly. However, even with a run of 25000 iterations, the effective sample size is still small for both samplers.

Side note: the random effects variance component in this model is given a gamma prior on the precision scale, but best practices for random effects variance components, including a strong argument against the gamma/inverse-gamma prior, can be found in Gelman (2006, Bayesian Analysis 1:515-534).
