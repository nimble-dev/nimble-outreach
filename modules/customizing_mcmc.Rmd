# The pump model

Here's the graph of the pump model.

Here we set up the pump model.

```{r, pump-code}
```
```{r, pump-model}
```
```{r, pump-compile}
```

# NIMBLE's default MCMC

Here are the results from running NIMBLE's default MCMC:

```{r, pump-default, fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
pumpConf <- configureMCMC(pump, print = TRUE)
pumpConf$addMonitors(c('alpha', 'beta', 'theta'))
pumpMCMC <- buildMCMC(pumpConf)
CpumpMCMC <- compileNimble(pumpMCMC, project = pump)

niter <- 1000
burnin <- 200

CpumpMCMC$run(niter)
samples <- as.matrix(CpumpMCMC$mvSamples)

library(coda)
mcmc <- as.mcmc(samples[(burnin+1):nrow(samples), ])
crosscorr(mcmc[ , c('alpha', 'beta', 'theta[1]', 'theta[2]', 'theta[3]')])
effectiveSize(mcmc)

par(mfrow = c(1, 4), mai = c(.6, .5, .1, .2))
tsplot(samples[ , 'alpha'], xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(alpha), main = expression(alpha))
tsplot(samples[ , 'beta'], xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(beta), main = expression(beta))
plot(samples[ , 'alpha'], samples[ , 'beta'], xlab = expression(alpha),
     ylab = expression(beta), main = paste(expression(alpha), expression(beta), "dependence"))
tsplot(samples[ , 'theta[1]'], xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(theta[1]), main = expression(theta[1]))
```

# Customizing samplers

As those who've worked with MCMC before know, MCMC is a family of algorithms and there are many ways to run an MCMC for any given model, including the choice of the kind of sampler used for each parameter in the model. 

One of NIMBLE's most important features is that users can easily modify the MCMC algorithm used for their model. The easiest thing to do is to start with NIMBLE's default MCMC and then make modifications. 

```{r customize-mcmc}
pumpConf <- configureMCMC(pump)
pumpConf$addMonitors(c('alpha', 'beta', 'theta'))
pumpConf$getSamplers()
pumpConf$removeSamplers('alpha')
pumpConf$addSampler(target = c('alpha'), type = 'slice')

pumpMCMC <- buildMCMC(pumpConf)
CpumpMCMC <- compileNimble(pumpMCMC, project = pump, resetFunctions = TRUE)

Cpump$setInits(pumpInits)
set.seed(0)
CpumpMCMC$run(niter)
```

We can look at diagnostics and see if the change in samplers had an effect. Interestingly, despite the posterior correlation between ```alpha``` and ```beta```, a simple change just to the univariate sampler for ```alpha``` has had a real effect on MCMC performance.

Caveat: the real question is the effective sample size per unit of computation time, but we don't assess that here.

```{r output2, fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
samples2 <- as.matrix(CpumpMCMC$mvSamples)

mcmc2 <- as.mcmc(samples2[(burnin+1):nrow(samples2), ])
crosscorr(mcmc2[ , c('alpha', 'beta', 'theta[1]', 'theta[2]', 'theta[3]')])
effectiveSize(mcmc2)

par(mfrow = c(1, 4), mai = c(.6, .5, .1, .2))
plot(samples2[ , 'alpha'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(alpha), main = expression(alpha))
plot(samples2[ , 'beta'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(beta), main = expression(beta))
plot(samples2[ , 'alpha'], samples2[ , 'beta'], xlab = expression(alpha),
     ylab = expression(beta), main = paste(expression(alpha), expression(beta), "dependence"))
plot(samples2[ , 'theta[1]'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(theta[1]), main = expression(theta[1]))
```

# Blocking parameters

Often a key factor that reduces MCMC performance is dependence between parameters that limits the ability of univariate samplers to move very far. A standard strategy is to sample correlated parameters in blocks. Unlike many other MCMC engines, NIMBLE makes it easy for users to choose what parameters to sample in blocks.

We'll try that here for ```alpha``` and ```beta```.


```{r customize-mcmc2}
pumpConf$getSamplers()
pumpConf$removeSamplers(c('alpha', 'beta'))
pumpConf$addSampler(target = c('alpha','beta'), type = 'RW_block', 
control = list(adaptInterval = 100))

pumpMCMC <- buildMCMC(pumpConf)
CpumpMCMC <- compileNimble(pumpMCMC, project = pump, resetFunctions = TRUE)

Cpump$setInits(pumpInits)
set.seed(0)
CpumpMCMC$run(niter)


```{r output3, fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
samples3 <- as.matrix(CpumpMCMC$mvSamples)
mcmc3 <- as.mcmc(samples3[(burnin+1):nrow(samples3), ])
crosscorr(mcmc3[ , c('alpha', 'beta', 'theta[1]', 'theta[2]', 'theta[3]')])
effectiveSize(mcmc3)

par(mfrow = c(1, 4), mai = c(.6, .5, .1, .2))
plot(samples3[ , 'alpha'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(alpha), main = expression(alpha))
plot(samples3[ , 'beta'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(beta), main = expression(beta))
plot(samples3[ , 'alpha'], samples3[ , 'beta'], xlab = expression(alpha),
     ylab = expression(beta), main = paste(expression(alpha), expression(beta), "dependence"))
plot(samples3[ , 'theta[1]'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(theta[1]), main = expression(theta[1]))

```

In this case the block sampler appears to be less effective, but it might just be that the adaptation hasn't had enough time to take full effect in only 1000 iterations.  Very often block sampling gives big improvements.
