# A very basic MCMC

The steps of running an MCMC are as follows:

 - configure the MCMC
 - build the MCMC
 - create a compiled version of the MCMC
 - run the MCMC
 - assess and use the MCMC samples


# Build the model

We first need to build the model.

```{r, pump-code}
```

```{r, pump-model}
```

```{r, pump-compile}
```

# Configuring a basic MCMC

Setting up and running an MCMC in NIMBLE takes a few more steps than in BUGS or JAGS, but with the benefit of giving the user much more control of how the MCMC operates.

First we *configure* the MCMC, which means setting up the samplers to be used for each node or group of nodes. NIMBLE provides a default configuration, but we'll see shortly how you can modify that. 

```{r, conf}
pumpConf <- configureMCMC(pump, print = TRUE)
```
You also specify what nodes you'd like to get the MCMC samples provided as output.

```{r, monitor}
pumpConf$addMonitors(c('alpha', 'beta', 'theta'))
```

# Building the MCMC algorithm for the model 

Next we'll build the MCMC algorithm for the model under the default configuration. And we'll create a compiled (i.e., C++) version of the MCMC that is equivalent in functionality but will run much faster.

```{r build-mcmc}
pumpMCMC <- buildMCMC(pumpConf)
CpumpMCMC <- compileNimble(pumpMCMC, project = pump)
```

# Running the MCMC

Now let's run the MCMC. We don't recommend running the R version of the MCMC for very many iterations - it's really slow - in part because iterating in R is slow and in part because iterating with a model in NIMBLE requires even more overhead. 

```{r run-mcmc}
niter <- 1000
set.seed(0)
print(system.time(pumpMCMC$run(5)))  # R version
set.seed(0)
print(system.time(
CpumpMCMC$run(niter)
))
```

# Working with MCMC output

The R and C MCMC samples are the same, so you can use the R MCMC for debugging. It's possible to step through the code line by line using R's debugging capabilities (not shown).

```{r Rmcmc}
Rsamples <- as.matrix(pumpMCMC$mvSamples)
samples <- as.matrix(CpumpMCMC$mvSamples)

identical(Rsamples, samples[1:5, ])
```

Now let's look at the MCMC performance

```{r output-mcmc, fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
tsplot <- function(x, ...) plot(seq_along(x), x, type = 'l', ...)

par(mfrow = c(1, 4), mai = c(.6, .5, .1, .2))
tsplot(samples[ , 'alpha'], xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(alpha), main = expression(alpha))
tsplot(samples[ , 'beta'], xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(beta), main = expression(beta))
plot(samples[ , 'alpha'], samples[ , 'beta'], xlab = expression(alpha),
     ylab = expression(beta), main = paste(expression(alpha), expression(beta), "dependence"))
tsplot(samples[ , 'theta[1]'], xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(theta[1]), main = expression(theta[1]))
```

# Using CODA

NIMBLE does not provide any MCMC diagnostics. (At least not yet; there's no reason one couldn't write code for various diagnostics using the NIMBLE system.)  But one can easily use CODA or other R packages with the MCMC output from a NIMBLE MCMC.

```{r coda}
library(coda)
burnin <- 100
mcmc <- as.mcmc(samples[(burnin+1):nrow(samples), ])
crosscorr(mcmc[ , c('alpha', 'beta', 'theta[1]', 'theta[2]', 'theta[3]')])
effectiveSize(mcmc)
```

One could apply the commonly used Gelman-Rubin potential scale reduction factor diagnostic, but one would need to run multiple chains.

# Running multiple chains

At the moment, we haven't set up NIMBLE to automatically run multiple chains, such as would be needed for calculation of the Gelman-Rubin potential scale reduction factor (*gelman.diag()* in the *coda* package). But it's straightforward to do this yourself.

```{r, multi-chain}
nChains <- 3
pumpInits <- list(list(alpha = 1, beta = 1), list(alpha = 0.1, beta =30), list(alpha = 30, beta = 0.1))
out <- list()
set.seed(0)
niter <- 3000
burnIn <- 1000
for(ch in seq_len(nChains)) {
       Cpump$setInits(pumpInits[[ch]])
       Cpump$simulate(pump$getDependencies(c('alpha','beta')))
       Cmcmc <- compileNimble(pumpMCMC, project = pump, resetFunctions = TRUE)
       Cmcmc$run(niter)
       out[[ch]] <- as.mcmc(as.matrix(Cmcmc$mvSamples)[(1+burnIn):niter, ])
}
```

Considerations: you'll want to think about how to set up the over-dispersed starting points and the number of iterations to use for burn-in.




# Assessing MCMC performance from multiple chains

```{r, gelman-rubin}
smp <- do.call(mcmc.list, out)
gelman.diag(smp)
# and here's a graphical representation of the information
tsplot(out[[1]][ , 'alpha'], xlab = 'iteration',
     ylab = expression(alpha), main = expression(alpha))
sq <- seq_along(out[[1]][ , 'alpha'])
for(i in 2:3)
      lines(sq, out[[i]][ , 'alpha'], col = i)
```
