We'll be offering a short course on the NIMBLE hierarchical modeling system for attendees of the ISBA world meeting in Sardinia on June 12. Here are the details.

Programming with models: An introduction to NIMBLE, a JAGS/BUGS-compatible system for using, coding, and disseminating algorithms for hierarchical statistical models

This short course will introduce attendees to the NIMBLE system for programming with hierarchical models in R. NIMBLE (r-nimble.org) is a new system for flexible programming of algorithms that builds on the BUGS language for declaring hierarchical models. NIMBLE provides analysts with a flexible system for using MCMC, sequential MC and other techniques on user-specified models. It provides developers and methodologists with the ability to write algorithms in an R-like syntax that can be easily disseminated to users. C++ versions of models and algorithms are created for speed, but these are manipulated from R without any need for analysts or algorithm developers to program in C++. The short course will first show how to specify a hierarchical statistical model using BUGS syntax and fit that model using MCMC. Participants will learn how to customize the MCMC for better performance and how to specify one's own statistical distributions and functions to extend the syntax of BUGS. Finally, the course will show how to use the system to write algorithms for use with any hierarchical model (including user-defined MCMC samplers that can be mixed and matched with the default samplers available in the system). This system provides a way for an algorithm developer to easily disseminate their method to users, without the overhead of having to write general code for defining and manipulating hierarchical models.
